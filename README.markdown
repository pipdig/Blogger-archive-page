# Make Archive Page in Blogger

This little piece of JavaScript takes JSON from the the Google API for Blogger and outputs html that can be interpretted by the blogging platform to produce a hyperlinked list of blog titles followed by the date. An example might be

> [GitHub for Mac 1.2: Snow Octocat](https://github.com/blog/1067-github-for-mac-1-2-snow-octocat) (March 2, 2012)

(Provided the GitHub blog were on Blogger.)

The archive style was inspired by the [ET notebooks][1] by Edward Tufte.

## How to implement it

Copy and paste the following the code into your the html for your new page in Blogger:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jhwilson/Create-a-Blogger-archive-page/Make-Blogger-Archive-Page.js">
    </script>
    <script src="/feeds/posts/default?max-results=500&amp;alt=json-in-script&amp;callback=LoadTheArchive">
    </script>
